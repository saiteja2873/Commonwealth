            <h1>  Nurse</h1>
                    <h3>Nursing involves assisting ill, injured and weak people towards health and helping to relieve patients of pain and discomfort. <br><br>It also involves curative, preventative, promotive and rehabilitative health care for families, communities and individuals. </h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> There are two main categories of nursing, namely the registered or professional nurse and the enrolled nursing auxiliary.</p><p>

                    Registered nurses or nursing sisters take patients’ blood pressures and temperatures. They take samples for laboratory tests. They administer medication and give patients injections. They put in and remove stitches; apply and change dressings on wounds. Nurses prepare patients for medical checkups and for operations. They may assist surgeons and anaesthetists during operations and obstetricians in maternity wards and act as midwives.</p><p>
                    
                    Nursing sisters also participate in activities such as supplying health guidance and counselling, and also the diagnosis, planning and execution of nursing strategies for patients.</p><p>
                    
                    There are three main categories of nursing, namely the registered or professional nurses, the enrolled nurse and the enrolled nursing auxiliary. All nurses, perform certain duties, particularly during training, but others’ responsibilities and work varies. All three categories register with the SA Nursing Council once they have completed their training.</p>

            <h1> Design </h1>
                    <h3>Design engineers produce designs for new or improved engineering products.<br><br> They work on a very wide range of highly sophisticated products and structures, including aircraft, bridges, medical equipment and agricultural machinery, computers and telecommunications systems.</h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> Design engineers begin each project by looking at a ‘brief’, (a set of instructions) which explains what the aim of the project is. A car manufacturer, for example, may want to increase sales of one of their cars by reducing fuel consumption or improving the look of a new model. Design engineers are responsible for making sure that the product meets the manufacturer’s needs and is safe, efficient, reliable, and is economical to produce. Before they prepare a design, engineers gather information by talking to other experts, reading engineering literature and looking at the results of test data on materials and processes.</p><p>

                    Engineers use computer-aided design (CAD) techniques to produce a design on a visual display screen. The computer performs all the necessary calculations relating to the weight of parts and the loads they must bear. The engineer can compare possible solutions by using drawings, calculations, and physical and computer models. Engineers work on models to check and measure the way a product works, which may result in them having to modify their design.</p>

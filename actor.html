            <h1> Actor</h1>
            <p><h3>Actors express ideas and create images using speech, make-up, costumes and gestures to portray characters in productions in theatre, film, radio, television, and other performing arts media. They interpret writers' scripts to entertain, inform or instruct an audience.</h3></p>


                <p><h3>Although most famous actors work in film, television or theatre, far more work in local or regional television studios, theatres or film production companies preparing advertising, public-relations, or independent, small-scale movie productions. </h3></p><hr><br><br>
                <p>Actors perform in stage, radio, television, video, or motion picture productions. 
                    They also work in cabarets, nightclubs, theme parks, commercials, and "industrial" films produced for training and educational purposes. </p><p>
                    Most actors struggle to find steady work; only a few ever achieve recognition as stars. Some well-known, experienced performers may be cast in supporting roles. </p>Others work as "extras," with no lines to deliver, or make brief, 'cameo' appearances, speaking only one or two lines. Some actors do voiceover and narration work for advertisements, animated features, books on tape, and other electronic media. 
                    <p>They also teach in high school or university drama departments, acting conservatories, or public programs.</p>

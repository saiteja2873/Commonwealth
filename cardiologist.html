            <h1> Cardiologist</h1>
                    <h3>Cardiologists are heart specialists, who are medical doctors trained to treat abnormalities and diseases of the heart and cardiovascular system. <br>They use a stethoscope to listen to the patientâ€™s heart and an electrocardiograph to make recordings of the activity. They study X-rays to determine the existence or extent of a heart disorder. </h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> The field of cardiology features several subspecialties:</p>


                   <p> Non-invasive cardiologists are concerned only with diagnosing ailments.</p>   <p>They do not conduct surgery or provide other treatment. </p>
                    
                    
                   <p> Interventional cardiologists perform invasive tests and procedures to diagnose and treat cardiac disease. </p>
                    
                    
                   <p> Cardiovascular surgeons operate on the heart, veins and arteries.  Invasive non-interventional cardiologists perform cardiac catheterisations by placing a tube through a blood vessel to obtain a picture of the diseased portion of the heart. If a pacemaker is required, they would implant it. </p>
                    
                    
                   <p> Heart surgery includes coronary bypass surgery (where a graft is made from a section of a vein or artery removed elsewhere in the body and used to carry blood around portions of narrowed vessels). Coronary bypass surgery is the most common procedure of this type. Other surgical procedures such as angioplasty and endarterectomy (surgically removing fatty deposits from closed or inflamed blood vessels), are often performed by cardiologists. In extreme cases, hearts may be transplanted from a suitable donor.</p>

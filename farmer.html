            <h1> Farmer </h1>
                    <h3>Farming covers the production of almost all kinds of animals, crops, fruits and vegetables suitable for a moderate to subtropical climate. <br><br>Farmers are responsible for most of the production of a country's foodstuffs either through crop or stock farming. Another important responsibility of farmers is the conservation of the country's natural resources.</h3><hr><p>


                    Farmers combine agricultural and business methods in operating small or large farms. Farmersâ€™ objectives are to make farming activities productive, profitable and professional.</p><p>

The nature of the work differs according to the size and type of farm. The topography, climate and vegetation of an area determine the type of farming practised. On small farms, farmers may perform the actual labour, as well as plan and direct farming operations.</p><p>

With crop farming, farmers perform a wide range of duties, such as determining land use, planting, fertilising, spraying, cultivating and harvesting procedures as well as marketing.</p><p>

On livestock farms, farmers take care of animals. The correct breeding or incubation programme as well as feeding programmes, need to be followed. Pastures have to be planned and controlled in such a way that enough grazing will be available for the animals. Animals must also be vaccinated against illnesses. Wool, meat and dairy products need to be processed and marketed.</p>

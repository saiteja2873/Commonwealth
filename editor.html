            <h1>  Editor</h1>
                    <h3>Editors are senior journalists allocated the responsibility of reviewing the content of a publication or section within a publication. <br><br>The type of employer determines the specific duties of the editor. However, most editors assign, accept or reject, prepare and sometimes write articles for publication. <br>They supervise the work of sub-editors, writers, reporters, photographers, typesetters, advertising and other workers.</h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> Editors may specialise by working for employers such as book, newspaper or magazine publishers. They can also specialise in a subject area such as food, the arts, finance, sport or travel.</p><p>

                    Editors in book publishing firms decide whether a manuscript has the potential to be a successful publication. Once a manuscript is approved, they arrange for the copyright, decide on the print, production techniques and promotion. Copy editors in publishing firms check through the text carefully, correct language and factual errors and sometimes do extensive rewriting.</p><p>
                    
                    A major part of an editor’s role is meeting deadlines, requiring excellent people management skills in order to do so. Editors in the newspaper industry in particular, work at a hectic pace to meet deadlines. Magazine editors and newspaper editors assign, accept or reject, prepare and sometimes write articles themselves for publication. Managing editors are the owners’ representatives and set editorial policy.</p>

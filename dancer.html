            <h1> Dancer </h1>
                    <h3>The term dancer covers a range of different styles of dancing, including: classical ballet, modern, ethnic, folk, jazz, contemporary, belly-dancing, country and western, dramatic dance, Spanish, tap, aerobic, mime, nightclub and ballroom. For as long as can be remembered, dancers have conveyed a concept or message to an audience and have expressed stories, rhythm, ideas and sound with their bodies. <br><br>.Those who dream of a dancing career rarely think about the reality of the self-discipline required and the rigorous and arduous lessons and rehearsals that require many hours including weekends and holidays. </h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> Professional dancers are subjected to prolonged, irregular and taxing working schedules that require physical and mental stamina. They participate in regular training sessions, rehearsals and performances. Dancing is a strenuous career and its demand for physical perfection requires constant attention to diet, fitness and health.</p><p>

                    The choreographer creates new dance works and should have a comprehensive knowledge of all the relevant aspects of dance in order to translate his ideas into dance compositions.</p><p>
                    
                    The choreologist notates new dance works and reads written notation scores: in this way he assists the dance master who is responsible for the teaching and rehearsing of dance repertoire.</p>

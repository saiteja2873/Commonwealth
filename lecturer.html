            <h1>Lecturer</h1>
                    <h3>Lecturers provide tuition and guidance to students at the tertiary level of education, in a specialized field. <br><br>Literally hundreds of subjects, each with its own requirements, are taught at college, university of technology or university. These requirements differ from one tertiary educational institution to another.</h3><hr><br><br>

                   <p> Lecturers are responsible for the preparation and presentation of their lectures. They have to prepare examination papers, invigilate at examinations and mark examination papers. Depending on their field of study, lecturers may be required to guide senior students in their independent study research.</p><p>


                    Other tasks include interviewing course applicants, having contact / teaching time with the students, checking and assessing students' work and encouraging personal development via pastoral or tutorial work.  They have to attend staff meetings, deal with general administration, manage research budgets and write research proposals, papers and other publications.</p><p>
                    
                    To be well informed, lecturers need to continuously try to uphold a culture of studying and reading publications, papers and articles relating to their field of study. Conducting research is a very important aspect of most lecturersâ€™ work and it is usually expected of them that they publish their own results, which is important for promotion, in addition to acting as research counsellors to their students.</p>
